# OntopStream Flink JDBC Driver

Flink JDBC driver is a Java library for accessing and manipulating [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) clusters by connecting to a [Flink SQL gateway](https://github.com/ververica/flink-sql-gateway) as the JDBC server.

Thi JDBC is an adaptation which supports continuous FlinkSQL queries over Flink dynamic tables.

This source code can be used for compiling a .jar JDBC driver file, which should be used by an __[OntopStream](https://github.com/chimera-suite/OntopStream)__ intance. No other tools have been tested with this driver.

This project is at an early stage. Feel free to file an issue if you meet any problems or have any suggestions.
